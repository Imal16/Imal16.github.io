        <h3>Here's a brief description of the design of the project</h3>
          <p>
            Disclaimer: I am not an expert in system design, and would welcome any feedback on the design/architecture.
          </p>
            <h4>Data Sources and API Manager </h4>
						<p>
              In terms of Data Sources, there's a mix of APIs and Webscrapers and the data from the responses are generally in json. Because I'm using Webscrapers I wanted to make sure 
              I had a long enough cooldown so that my ip wouldn't get blocked or banned, I know some of the websites I'm scrapping use Cloudflare so they might have a bot management service
              or something to prevent scraping. 
            </p>
            <p>
              It got to a point where I had multiple different data sources which had different request cooldown periods, different sources, and different frequency of retrieval 
              (Some data was available to be pulled EOD while others T+1). To handle this I created an API manager which handles the pulling of the data. I thought it would be 
              fun to explore Python's Asyncio because at work we started using threads for a couple of our service request calls. Asyncio isn't the same as multi-threading, threading 
              is preemptive, therefore it switches according to its scheduler. Asyncio is for coroutines: the developer has the control to decide when tasks switch execution by
              suspending certain tasks and resuming others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why use coroutines? I thought it would be interesting I tried finding different designs to handle this and couldn't find one. The idea was I have multiple 
              different APIs with different cooldown periods therefore while API A is on cooldown API B can run, but at the same time some APIs might take longer to 
              request the data due to the size of the responses and others are being inserted into the DB and some into a file store... This provides different opportunities to 
              switch contexts while it waits.
						</p>
						<h4>Data Storage</h4>
						<p>
              There are two main data storages: 
              </br>
              <br>
              1) I'm using Cockroach Labs Serverless DB, I came across Cockroach Labs while searching for various DBs to use  and thought it would
              be interesting to use. Their pitch is that they keep their DBs distributed and online to prevent interruptions and it is good for transaction-heavy workloads.
            </br>
            <br>
            2) I'm using a file store to store .json files. Why not use Mongo DB (NoSQL db)? Well, the free tier has 5GB of data, and I've already surpassed that... Also to be
              frank the data I'm collecting in .json files won't be used or read frequently. I don't have full usage of it at the moment, it will most likely
              be used for future features.
						</p>
            <h4>Calculation Engine</h4>
						<p>
						 I don't really have a Calc Engine, it's a module that has the models and logic used for various calculations. Some of these calculations are pretty intensive,
             which is why I separate it as an entity of its own. I've tried going from Pandas -> Vectorization -> Numpy -> Numba. Each improvement had a huge performance gain, 
             however the final numbers seemed a bit off. It's something I have to revisit, but just for argument's sake, those calculations went from ~25 mins to ~ 86 seconds (performed 
             on the largest data set, for smaller data sets I expect it to be nice and quick), but at the moment I prefer accuracy over performance. 
            <br>
            <br>
             The calculations are done through batch jobs, some calculations that are done daily, and others are done weekly, and monthly (after aggregating data)
             Similarly to how the raw data is stored, some if reinserted into the database, and others are stored into the file store.
						</p>
            <h4>Analytical Layer of Database</h4>
						<p>
            This is where I have the Data models the relations and tables in which the calculations are stored in the DB. These will feed into both the Reporting Layer and Visualization Layer
						</p>
            <h4>Reporting Layer</h4>
						<p>
              Why have a Separate Reporting Layer and Dashboard Layer? I wanted to have some logical processing happening before the Dashboard, recommendations, insights, etc... I viewed the Dashboard
              as a separate entity that can give the user the ability to View these insights, as well as the raw data. As the project grows I think this will be the right approach: separating 
              the general visualization from the logic and processing. 
						</p>
            <h4>Dashboard/Visualization Layer</h4>
						<p>
              Synthesized information from the reporting layer and visualization of the data. Gives the ability to the user to explore the data.
						</p>

        <h3>Ideation/Feature process</h3>
          <p>
            When you have a blank slate project with endless possibilities, I find it helpful to have some sort of process to help decide the order of features to tackle.
            When I first started, I focused on the big building blocks: Data + Apis (without the manager), Data Models + Data Storage, Calculation Engine, and Visualization (without dashboard).
            Now that I have those core infrastructure built, I use the following process to decide what to work on next:
          </br>
          </br>
            0) Check the backlog which is organized by priority, and take the highest priority item. But let's look at how I put an idea into the backlog and rank it (because that's probably more interesting).
          </br>
           </br>
            1) Ideation: Find an idea or topic. This can come from a tweet, an article I read, a section of a book, a podcast or interview I listened to, etc...
          </br>
          </br>
          2.1) Given that idea, I try to judge how important it would be. Is it something I want immediately in the project or is it something that may be nice to have? Will the use be frequent or is it sporadically useful?
          </br>
          </br>
          2.2) Do I already have the data for that idea? How hard is the acquisition of said data? (How much work? Is it feasible? Do I have a source?) Do I have to review or learn any theory? (ex: read a textbook chapter, read a book, research paper, review some math/stats?)
        </br></br>
          3) After assessing all this information, I try to size the work effort and guesstimate if the reward is worth pursuing immediately or if I am better off taking the top item from the backlog and placing this idea somewhere in the backlog.
