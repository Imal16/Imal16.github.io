						<h2>About Me</h2>

						<h3>Tech, Economics, and Finance</h3>
						<p>One of my favourite things about technology is that it acts as a catalyst for change. Innovations are so fasinating changing how we interact with each others and the world aound us. 
						This is one of the reasons I chose to study Computer Science, technology generally has two parts: hardware and software. I didn't really enjoy the hardware part so I opted for software.
						My Bachelor is in Computer Sciene with a minor in Analytical Economics, this helped foster my enjoyment of being around data and using data to help make informed decisions. </p>
						<p>The interest I have in economics stems from wanting to learn and understand how the world works. Essentially, it is part of the cogs which the world runs on and to some aspects 
							how we as individuals make our decisions (of course most economic models assume rationality, but time and time again we see that assumption fail).</p>
						<p>The Stock Market attracted a ton of interest in the recent months particularly with the GameStop fiasco, but its been a passion of mine for the last couple of years.
							 It's such an interest market, many. try and underperform, some over perform, but for short periods and very few consistently beat the market. It's like one big game that millions try
							and compete against each other, however with real monetary risk. Another cool thing is the abunance of diffent views and stategies that can be implemented.</p>

								<h3>Music & Sports</h3>
								<p>I'm a huge music listner, frankly can't live without it. Whenever I'm alone I'm most likely listening to something. I generally listen to Rap, Hip Hop, Grime and some EDM which rounds
									out my top genres. I generally just like good music, except Country, I don't think I can do that... As for sports I'm a pretty avid fan of the NHL and EPL, follow both closely probably
									because I used to play soccer and hockey as a kid and teen.
